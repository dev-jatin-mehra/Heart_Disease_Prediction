# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various factors.

## Factors

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **CP**: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
- **Fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exang**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
- **Ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
